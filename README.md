# SkinScanAI - Identify the precise area affected by the skin lesion.

The described project aims to address the challenges faced by dermatologists in locating cancerous and malignant skin lesions accurately and predicting skin lesion type. The proposed solution involves a neural architecture based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract essential features from skin lesions and generate precise masks that define the lesion area. The key components and outcomes of the project include:

1) Neural Architecture:

* The project utilizes a convolutional neural network, a type of deep learning model designed for image analysis tasks.
* The neural network is trained to extract features from skin lesions, which are crucial for accurately determining the location and spread of cancerous tumors and predicting type of skin lesions.
